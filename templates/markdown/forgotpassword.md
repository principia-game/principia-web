# Forgot password
Unfortunately we do not have the ability to automatically send password resets by email right now.

To request a password reset, you will need to send an email to [recovery@principia-web.se](mailto:recovery@principia-web.se) from the email address you registered the account with. This helps to verify that you are the owner of the account. You will receive a password reset link for the associated account in a reply.

Here is an email template that should work for most cases. It does not need to be more elaborate than so:

> Hello.
>
> I would like a password reset for the account "<username\>". This is being sent from the email I registered the account with.
>
> Thank you.

If you used a plus-sign or similar, please note that in the mail as email addresses are stored hashed in the database and needs an exact match to be verifiable. If you registered with an email address with a custom domain where you cannot send outbound mail, then please mention it and the reply will be sent to that address.

While you are waiting for a response, you may want to look into a password manager to store your passwords in a secure manner. We recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), which has a great security track record and has clients for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS as well as browser extensions to conveniently autofill login forms.
