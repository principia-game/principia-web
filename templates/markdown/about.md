# About Principia
Principia is, in its simplest form, a physics-based sandbox game. In Principia, you can build contraptions and simulate them in the physics simulation. This could be a mechanical contraption, an RC car, or a pinball game. Principia also contains a LuaScript object which allows you to write and create Lua programs that can interact with and affect the simulation.

Principia also features the Adventure game mode. In this game mode, you take control of a small robot which can do whatever you decide it to do. It can take part in a giant battle with enemy robots, or it can take control of the giant robot and wreak havoc on the world.

Principia was developed by the Swedish independent game company Bithack AB during 2013 and 2014. Sadly, the game doesn't exist in any official capacity due to Bithack not being able to finance the project anymore. It is however still loved by a small but passionate community that still keeps the game alive after all these years, including creating this site.
