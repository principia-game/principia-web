# Donations
Principia is an open source project, and in addition to being Free, the game is available for no cost to you, the player.

However, infrastructure for the project costs money, as well as test devices and other related expenses for the project. As such we would appreciate your financial support to keep the project going.

For the donation methods below, you will be making a payment directly to ROllerozxa. He is the current maintainer of the Principia open source project, as well as maintaining the web infrastructure, community spaces and the wiki documentation. Donations are primarily put towards server costs and other related expenses for the project, but excess funds may be used for personal survival costs.

## Liberapay
Liberapay works using recurring donations, kinda like Patreon but run by a non-profit. If you would like to make a one-time donation then make a pledge and cancel after the first payment.
